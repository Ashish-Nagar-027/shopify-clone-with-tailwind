# shopify-clone-with-tailwind
in this project i cloned shopify website which is an amazing site.<br />
it took me more than 8hrs to build this project .<br />
check it out - [Live Link of this project](https://shopify-clone-by-ashish.netlify.app/)

note: i have used direct cdn link from original site for images (logos,background images and etc) that why there is only html file and not other folders for assets <br/>
